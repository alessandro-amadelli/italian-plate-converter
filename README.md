# ITALIAN PLATE CONVERTER

### Italian plate converter is a highly intelligent program that recognizes every car plate!

Ok, ok...only the italian ones.  
And, yes...only the ones that follow the format 'AA000AA'.

### But it's still cool!


## HOW DOES IT WORK

### Launch command:

> python italian_plate_converter.py

### Steps:

1. Launch the program with the command above
2. Insert the first plate
3. The program will tell you the correspondent base 10 number
4. Insert the second plate
5. The program will tell you the correspondent base 10 number and the difference between the two plates
